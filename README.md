# SOC-Automation

## Objective

The objective of this SOC automation project is to enhance incident response efficiency, reduce manual effort and human error, and improve threat detection accuracy by automating detection, analysis, and response processes. Additionally, it aims to standardize workflows, increase situational awareness, and optimize resource utilization, resulting in cost efficiency and better compliance with security policies. Ultimately, the project seeks to strengthen the overall security posture and adaptability to evolving threats.


### Skills Learned

- Developing proficiency in scripting languages such as Python, PowerShell, or Bash to create and manage automation workflows.
- Enhancing skills in handling security incidents, from detection and triage to response and remediation, using automated tools and playbooks.
- Deepening knowledge of SIEM platforms, like Splunk, focusing on how to configure and optimize them for automated threat detection and response.
- Strengthening foundational cybersecurity knowledge, including network security, endpoint protection, and compliance requirements.

### Tools Used
- Wazuh Server for detection
- Wazuh Agent to query reports
- Shuffle SOAR to develope workflows and automation
